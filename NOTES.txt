(*) There are pressure floors hardwired in SUBBROUTINE PRS2EOS(PRS,RHO) in
    PHYSICS.f90, as well as SUBROUTINE EOS(P,RHO,ENE,CHIS) in that same
    file. These are currently set to P = 1.e-28 in geometrized units, 
    about 5.5e11 dyn/cm^2 in CGS -- less than 1 g/cm^3 in density for
    cold Helmholtz.

   It would be good to make these more readily defined, perhaps as preprocessor
   variables.

(*) The surface is defined in RHOSURFTOV, PSURFTOV for the TOV solver, and
    RHOSURF and PSURF for the hydro solver. These are also hardwired and
    may not be equal.

   These values too should be added as preprocessed variables, perhaps
   with a logical check to ensure they exceed the pressure/density 
   floor of the EOS routines.


Note on Geometrized Units
=========================
XNS uses geometrized units, where the speed of light c = 1, the gravitational constant G = 1, and the mass of the Sun M_sun = 1. This means that all units can efectively be expressed in terms of length.

Length
------
L = G M_sun / c^2 = 1.48 km = 1.48 x 10^5 cm

Time
----
T = L / c = G M_sun / c^3 = 4.93 x 10^-6 s

Mass
----
Solar masses (M_sun)

Mass Density
------------
rho = M_sun / L^3 = c^6 / (G^3 M_sun^2) = 6.16 x 10^17 g/cm^3

Pressure
--------
P = rho * c**2 = c^8 / (G^3 M_sun^2) = 5.55 x 10^38 dyn/cm^2
